# Analyze-scientific-literature-on-arxiv

This project was developed during my master's studies for the Big Data Analysis
course. The main objective was to analyze the dataset: arXiv Dataset, utilizing
PySpark as the processing environment. The project focused on achieving the
following objectives:

* Exploratory data analysis (plots and data preparation)
* Query for similar articles (KNN for most similar articles based on embeddings and cosine similarity)
* Topic extraction
* Classification (supervised training using category information and embeddings with stratified sampling, logistic regression, decision trees)
* Citation graphs (analyze citation graphs using Spark GraphX, based on article authors collaborations)
* Implementation in Python, using Google Colab
